# Image-Processing-

Here I have used pillow library for the post processing of the image. 


To download the pillow module code is:
pip install pillow

Keep this sample photo in the same folder as same as the python file

I have kept the image file and the logo file in the same directory as the python file and is saves in  .png format.The new editted image gets saved in the same directory as the python file after processing.
This is a user input program which helps in selecting  specific operation like brightness, contrast, blurryness,inverting ,some filters and upto which range.
